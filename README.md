# Ringviz - A ThreeJS Toy
A **Ring** **Viz**ualization demo. Okay more of an abstract speaker vizualizing music, image is below. Result of playing around with ThreeJS, FFT and sound. A personal learning experience of varying aesthetic quality. Code is pretty sphaget, but works-on-my-machine(tm) :spaghetti:

Best viewed on non-mobile devices.
